# PUC Minas Practice Repository

Welcome to the **PUC Minas Practice Repository**! ðŸš€  
This repository is part of my studies at PUC Minas and contains coding challenges and solutions focused on array manipulation. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills in topics such as sorting, searching, and advanced array techniques, as part of my Computer Science learning journey.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- Merging sorted arrays
- Searching elements
- Sorting techniques
- Two-pointer techniques
- Sliding window problems
- Prefix sum and subarray problems

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** (Primary Language - `.kts` Scripts)
- **JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA** (Development Environment)
- Java (Optional Implementations, if needed)
